## Introduction

Humanity has experienced tremendous growth over the past two centuries due to the power of innovation in different areas such as medicine, business and engineering. This immense growth has led us to live in a very prosperous era. Different organizations have sought to collect data in order to examine prosperity.

Gapminder has collected 200 years' worth of data on human progress. The Heritage Foundation has focused more on collecting data centered around economic progress. Finally, the United Nations has also developed data related to human development. Datasets from these sources were combined to form a new dataset. This novel dataset has mulitple features that describe countries' attributes and performance. These features can be called indicators.

Some countries were ommitted from the dataset during data collection because there was not enough data on them. These countries are Hong Kong, Swaziland, The Bahamas, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Laos, Kyrgyz Republic, The Gambia, Macau, Eswatini, Taiwan and Liechtenstein.
