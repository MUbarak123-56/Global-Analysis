# Global Prosperity Projects

Humanity has experienced tremendous growth over the past two centuries due to the power of innovation in different areas such as medicine, business and engineering. This immense growth has led us to live in a very prosperous era. Different organizations have sought to collect data in order to examine prosperity. Gapminder has collected 200 years' worth of data on human progress. The Heritage Foundation has focused more on collecting data centered around economic progress. Finally, the United Nations has also developed data related to human development. Datasets from these sources were combined to form a new dataset. This novel dataset has mulitple features that describe countries' attributes and performance. These features can be called indicators.
This is a repository for analyzing the indicators that lead to prosperity in nations. Different variables shall be examined in terms of how they relate to one another, and how different nations/continents perform with respect to these variables.

### Coding Platforms/Technologies
Here are some platforms that will be used to analyze and explore the datasets to extract crucial insights. 
* Tableau
* R
* Python
* pandas
* seaborn

## Data Collection & Wrangling

Data was collected from The Heritage Foundation, Gapminder Foundation and the United Nations. Then, the datasets were wrangled to have a better understanding of them using Python and R. The reasoning behind utilizing both R and Python was to get the experience of using both platforms for Data Wrangling. Using R, it was possible to create a new dataset called New_world.csv. This dataset was created by combining both the economic freedom data from Heritage Foundation and the progress data from the Gapminder Foundation. Then, python was used to wrangle the datasets to create a new dataset called World_data.csv. The main difference between New_world.csv and World_data.csv is that World_data.csv includes the United Nations' indicators' datasets. World_data.csv was thoroughly created to ensure that all the important information was captured. This ensured that we had a comprehensive dataset.
