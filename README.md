# Global Prosperity Projects

Humanity has experienced tremendous growth over the past two centuries due to the power of innovation in different areas such as medicine, business and engineering. This immense growth has led us to live in a very prosperous era. Different organizations have sought to collect data related to prosperity. Gapminder has collected 200 years' worth of data on human progress. The Heritage Foundation has focused more on collecting data centered around economic progress. Finally, the United Nations has also developed data related to human development. Datasets from these sources were combined to form a new dataset. This novel dataset has mulitple features that describe countries' attributes and performance. These features can be called indicators.
This is a repository for analyzing the indicators that lead to prosperity in nations. Different variables shall be examined in terms of how they relate to one another, and how different nations/continents perform with respect to these variables.
